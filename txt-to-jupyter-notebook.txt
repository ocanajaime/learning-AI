On Sunday, No Stone Left Alone will hold remembrance ceremonies in more than 55 communities, in an effort to reach its goal of having a student place a poppy on the headstone of every Canadian who has served in the country’s armed forces.

A small group of volunteers will host a similar memorial, visiting the graves of who they consider to be Canada’s forgotten soldiers — those who fought in the Spanish Civil War, which lasted from July 1936 to April 1939.


Pamela Vivian of Victoria, B.C., is organizing a trip to cemeteries across Metro Vancouver on Sunday, placing a white rose on the graves of Canadians who fought in Spain. She hopes to find volunteers to visit each of the more than 220 known graves of Spanish Civil War veterans across Canada.

“They’re not recognized here in Canada, no one talks about them, barely anyone knows about them,” Vivian said.

“When you start doing the research you start falling in love with them and feel terrible that nobody knows about them and nobody’s acknowledging them. So it’s just a little way to pay tribute to these people.”

More than 1,600 Canadians fought alongside the Spanish Army against insurgent forces and did so against the wishes of the Canadian government, which had — like many other Western countries — decided to stay out of the conflict between the democratically-elected Republican government and the Nationalists led by Gen. Francisco Franco.
